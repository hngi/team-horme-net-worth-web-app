                <p> You probably know the meaning of the term net worth</p>
				<p> You've heard some actor is worth $10 million. But what does that exactly mean?<Br>
				And why should you care about your net worth?</p>
				<p>Net worth is the best way to undersatnd your financial health, if you track it over time <br>
				your net worth will illustrate the progress you are making towards paying off debt</p>
				<p>Your net worth is not about your in come- your income does not even factor into your net <br>
				worth. Instead net worth includes savings, investments and debts. 
				</p>
				<p>
				Think about it this way, if you make $30,000 per year, but you have an investment <br>
				portfolio worth $3.5 million, you are going to be more concerned about your total net<br>
				worth because the $30,000 you make is very small part of your financial situation.
